# hello! 👋
hi there, i'm sometimeskieran.

this github is where a lot of my projects will be stored.

i work on a lot of minecraft bedrock related projects, such as Pocketmine plugins and custom texture packs (esp. with JSON UI). when I'm not messing with that stuff, i'm either writing, editing or gaming.

if you want to work with me on anything, reach out on discord.

###### there isn't much public though!
a lot of my projects are private and so there isn't much to show publically. but stay tuned!
